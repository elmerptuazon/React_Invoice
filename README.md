## Notice

Lumen 8.x

I can't run middleware or custom authserviceprovider due to bug of $next($request) show Unable to resolve Route Handler. Manually declared auth per method. I already installed Fruitcake/Cors(former Barryvdh Cors) in Lumen still not working on version 8.

## Notes
I used react-admin template(https://github.com/marmelab/react-admin) for creating template.
Since the request is being blocked. I used json file as backup for the database part.
